# Claude Code Analytics Dashboard - Phase Summary

## Project Overview

Personal usage analytics dashboard for Claude Code CLI with beautiful visualizations and detailed usage tracking. All data remains local with PostgreSQL database and React frontend.

## Current Status: Phase 2.1 Complete (30% Overall Progress)

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Data Pipeline (100% Complete)

- **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL with hybrid normalized approach for sessions, metrics, and raw messages
- **JSONL Parser**: Robust parser for Claude Code conversation files with validation and error handling
- **Data Insertion Pipeline**: Incremental data processing with duplicate detection and batch operations
- **Data Sync System**: Manual sync with progress tracking and comprehensive logging
- **Database Utilities**: Connection management, migrations, and data cleanup functions
- **API Migration**: Migrated from Express to Fastify server with proper separation of responsibilities

### ✅ Phase 2.1: Frontend Foundation (100% Complete)

- **Development Environment**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript with hot module replacement
- **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS v3 with custom orange theme (#FF6B35) and dark gradients
- **Routing**: TanStack Router with file-based routing for type-safe navigation and search params
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for server state management, caching, and background updates
- **UI Components**: Basic dashboard, sessions, and settings pages with responsive dark theme
- **Development Server**: Running on port 5174 with API proxy to backend on port 3001
- **PostCSS Configuration**: Fixed CSS compilation pipeline for proper Tailwind processing

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Fastify + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript + TanStack Router + TanStack Query + Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with hybrid normalized schema
- **Development**: File-based routing, hot reload, TypeScript inference throughout

## Key Features Implemented

- ✅ JSONL conversation file parsing with validation
- ✅ Incremental data sync from `~/.claude/projects/` directory
- ✅ Database schema for sessions, metrics, and message storage
- ✅ RESTful API with proper error handling
- ✅ Dark theme UI with orange accent colors
- ✅ Type-safe routing with search parameter management
- ✅ Responsive layout with navigation and basic pages

## Development Workflow Established

- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches for each phase, merge to main when complete
- **Commit Style**: Conventional commits with detailed descriptions and Claude Code attribution
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and graceful degradation
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript throughout, ESLint configuration, proper imports

## Recent Accomplishments (This Session)

1. **Fixed Tailwind CSS Issues**: Resolved PostCSS compilation errors by reverting from v4 to v3
2. **Package Dependencies**: Fixed TanStack Query DevTools import and PostCSS plugin configuration
3. **CSS Compilation**: Ensured custom orange colors (#FF6B35) are properly generated and applied
4. **Development Server**: Confirmed working setup with backend proxy and hot reload
5. **Git Integration**: Committed Phase 2.1 completion and merged to main branch

## Next Steps: Phase 2.2 - Design System & Components

- Create reusable UI component library
- Implement chart components with Recharts
- Build data visualization patterns
- Establish loading states and error boundaries
- Create responsive grid layouts for dashboard

## Current Development Commands

```bash
# Backend (Port 3001)
cd /path/to/project
npm run dev:server

# Frontend (Port 5174)  
cd /path/to/project/frontend
npm run dev

# Database
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

## Project Metrics

- **Overall Progress**: 30% complete (Phase 1: 100%, Phase 2.1: 100%)
- **Files Created**: 50+ files across backend and frontend
- **Lines of Code**: ~8000+ lines (including dependencies and generated code)
- **Git Commits**: 15+ commits with proper conventional commit format
- **Development Time**: Multiple focused sessions with iterative improvement

## Key Technical Decisions

- **TanStack Technologies**: Chosen for type safety, performance, and developer experience
- **Monorepo Structure**: Separate `/frontend` directory for clean separation of concerns  
- **Dark Theme First**: Modern aesthetic with orange accent color for engagement
- **File-based Routing**: TanStack Router for maintainable and type-safe navigation
- **Hybrid Database Schema**: Balance between query performance and data integrity
- **Manual Sync Strategy**: User-controlled data updates for transparency and control

## Lessons Learned

- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Too early for production use, reverted to stable v3
- **PostCSS Configuration**: Critical for proper CSS compilation in Vite environment
- **Package Dependencies**: Precise package placement (dev vs prod) crucial for build process
- **Development Server**: Proxy configuration essential for full-stack development
- **Error Resolution**: Systematic approach to debugging CSS compilation issues
